# DermoDeX - Mint 20
Cinnamon Theme Engine

DermoDeX is a dynamic cinnamon theme that responds to the currently selected background wallpaper. It uses a function based python script to determin not the main color in a wallpaper but a color that may be considered an accent. For example in an image of the milkyway with brown mountains in the forground, DermoDeX will attempt to extract a color that would be complimentary to the image.

This accent color is then passed to the cinnamon.css and the gtk stylesheets too.
